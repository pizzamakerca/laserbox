# laserbox
## About

This repository contains an Arduino sketch used to control relay modules interfaced with an sACN enabled control system.  The purpose was to enable DMX control over lasers mounted in an art installation.  The sketch relies heavily on the e131.h library provided by Shelby Merrick.  More infromation about the library may be found here: http://www.forkineye.com
